Leo-editor is a great tool. It was written by [Edward K. Ream](http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/ekr.html), and contributed by many other warmhearted man.

You can find tutorial and user's guide at [Leo-editor home page](http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/front.html).

In fact, this short faq is my second iteration study notes of Leo-editor ;-)

# Basic Concepts
## UNL
1. Q: the UNL (Uniform Node Location), the path from the top of the outline to the selected node, will be showed at the status area. 
but, how to use UNL? or, this message is not important, only prompt the user where he is?

> A1: [Terry Brown](https://plus.google.com/116859937287332241707): They are useful as bookmarks.  You can right-click select all / copy
> them, then paste them into a node, as the first line.  Make the
> headline of the node something like "@url link to priority items", then
> when you double click that node, Leo will jump to the place where you
> copied the UNL, even opening another outline if needed (i.e. if the UNL
> you copied was in a different outline).

> A2: Although I double click the node will prompt I can change the content of headline, but when I press ctrl key, and click, it jumps!

## Marked Node
1. A red vertical bar denote the node is marked, but when the node need marked?
could you give me examples? thanks!

> A1: [Ville M. Vainio](https://plus.google.com/103097156557482112329/) One use case (that I personally use) is the clone-marked command. There are many others

> A2: Thanks.
> I tried this command(clone-marked). This just like I choose multiple nodes and clone them at once.
> The marked function like ctrl+click to choose multiples nodes, and "unmark all" means release ctrl key.
